                        Yup that's me! I live in Colorado. Moved here in February of 2018 and it has been quite the adventure. Before that I was living in Rhode Island for almost seven years. I had moved there for a job working with information technology in the motorcycle industry which was a great opportunity to combine two passions of mine. I went to school in Utah from 7th grade to college. Although I put my education on hold for my opportunity in Rhode Island I am planning on going back to finish a degree in Computer Engineering.
                    <br><br>
                        I enjoy riding motorcycles. I have been riding for about 10 years now. I own several motorcycles and each has its own charm when it comes to the style of riding. I love that motorcycles can make for a great tool for transportation but also a way to enjoy life. I personally choose to work on my bikes on my own if I can help it. There is a lot of pride when I'm able to get my hands dirty and end up with the results I want in the end.
                    <br><br>
                        I am also a huge fan of technology. I have been working with technology since I was about thirteen years old. My first computer I owned had a lot of issues; this gave me an opportunity to learn to resolve them. 
                    <br><br>    
                        Lately I have acquired a passion for hiking and camping. It's not something I ever did growing up. As odd as that may be since I was living in Utah. It's definitely something I had always been interested in and as of late I have been exploring my love for nature. It's always an adventure and never goes as expected.
